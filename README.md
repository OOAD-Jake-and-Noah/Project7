Currently there are no weird things to worry about in terms of running the program, the only comments are that invalid coordinates can cause issues (coordinates are 1-10 both X and Y) and it is possible to get a negative score by never getting any hits and that has possibility to break the leaderboard, but other than that no other known things to comment on.
