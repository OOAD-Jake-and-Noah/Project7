The way to run it is to run the driver. GUIDriver contains the singleton for the GUI, but also has the main that was used for testing/debugging the GUI seperate from the game engine. They are merged now and either should work, but using the normal driver is recommended. 
Currently there are no weird things to worry about in terms of running the program, the only comments are that invalid coordinates can cause issues (coordinates are 1-10 both X and Y) and it is possible to get a negative score by never getting any hits and that has possibility to break the leaderboard, but other than that no other known things to comment on.
